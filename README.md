# Word-Guess-Game
## A Pokémon Safari

A game of hangman with a Pokémon-themed flair. To start, press any key after the website loads.

A Pokémon will appear from the tall grass! Guess its name to catch that 'mon.
If you fail to guess it within 8 tries, the Pokémon will flee and you'll lose a hit point (HP).
Never fear, simply press a key to try again!

There are a few features I didn't have time to implement:
* Obscuring Feature
    * I had intended to make the Pokémon be obscured when it first appeared, and correct key strokes would clear up the image. However, I lacked the skill the implement this feature in time.
* Pokécenter
    * On HP = 0, I intended to halt the game in order to send the player to the Pokémon Center. This would clear all fields and restart the game on key press. However, I ran out of time for this one, too.

I'm very well aware that it is not coded in the cleanest or prettiest fashion, and it was certainly a challenge, but in the end I'm somewhat happy with the result. Needs a lot of help to look better, too.

In the future I would love to finish what I've started, but for now, this'll do. :)
